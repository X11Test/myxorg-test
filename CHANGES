Changes 

3.3h Fix for TET_SAVE_FILES
	When TET_SAVE_FILES is set in the execute mode configuration
	and one of the directories visited during tcc's Saved Files
	processing is empty, tcc prints an error message which says that
	the Saved Files operation failed when in fact it was successful.
	/src/tet3/tcclib/lsdir.c
     Updated perl API, for perl5 and adjustments for signal handling
        /src/perl/template.pl
        /src/perl/api.pl
     Update make compat target
        /src/makefile
     If a test case makes use of SIGPIPE, this can conflict with use of
     SIGPIPE in the API.  This problem affects Distributed TET on
     Solaris systems, and other systems where the default is for
     signal() to have SYSV behaviour.

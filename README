This is a revamped version of X Test Suite (XTS) which removes some of
the ugliness of building and running the tests.

Downloading
===========
Currently xts it is only available from a git repository.

	$ git clone git://people.freedesktop.org/~dbn/xtest.git

Eventually there will be a tarball release when it is stabilized.

Requirements
============
Required libraries: libX11, libXext, libXi, libXtst
Required utilities: xdpyinfo, xset, perl, bdftopcf, mkfontdir

If you are using packages outside of the standard system directories,
make sure to set PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH appropriately. See
pkg-config(1) for details on the latter.

Build and Install
=================
The build and install are now straightforward:

	$ ./autogen.sh	# using a git checkout
	$ ./configure	# using a tarball
	$ make
	$ make install

Running the Tests
=================
The tests can be run from the build directory or from the installed
package. The "make check" framework can be used from the build tree.

	$ make check			# run all the tests
	$ make check scenario=XI	# run just the XI test scenario
	$ make test-XI			# shortcut for the previous

A wrapper script, xts-run, is the easiest way to run the installed tests.

	$ xts-run	# run all the tests
	$ xts-run XI	# run just the XI test scenario

By default, the test output will go to xts-results/<date> in the current
directory. This can be changed with the xts-run -o parameter. The output
contains the full journal of all test output plus individual logs for
each test program. Journal files from completed runs can be analyzed by
the xts-report tool (formerly vswrpt):

	$ xts-report -f /xts/output/dir/journal

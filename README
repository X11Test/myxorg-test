This is a revamped version of X Test Suite (XTS) which removes some of
the ugliness of building and running the tests. The build and install
are now straightforward:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

Required libraries: libX11, libXext, libXi, libXtst
Required utilities: xdpyinfo, xset, perl, bdftopcf, mkfontdir

The tests can be run from the source tree with "make check" or from the
installed package. A wrapper script, xts-run, is the easiest way to run
the installed tests.

	$ xts-run # run all the tests
	$ xts-run XI # run just the XI test scenario

The test output will go to a dated directory in the current directory by
default. This can be changed with the xts-run -o parameter. The output
contains the full journal of all test output plus individual logs for
each test program. Journal files from completed runs can be analyzed by
the xts-report tool (formerly vswrpt):

	$ xts-report -f /xts/output/dir/journal

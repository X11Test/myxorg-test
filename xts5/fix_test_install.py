"""Fix the name of install test binaries.

XTS expects to have many test files called TestN (where N is a number),
however meson has a limitation that a no two targets may have the same name,
even if they will not conflict at install time. This script fixes that in the
install directory by removing the prefix and reducing the test from
${name}_TestN to TestN.

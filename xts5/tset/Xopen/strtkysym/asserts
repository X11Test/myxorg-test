>>ASSERTION A XStringToKeysym-1
When the string argument is the name of a KeySym in the
table with the prefix XK_ removed, then a call to
XStringToKeysym returns that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym name in table with code 1:
	Call XStringToKeysym to obtain the KeySym defined for that string.
	Verify that XStringToKeysym did not return NoSymbol.
	Verify that the returned string is correct.
>>ASSERTION A XStringToKeysym-2
When the string argument is the name of a KeySym in the
table with the prefix XK_ removed, then a call to
XStringToKeysym returns that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym name in table with code 2:
	Call XStringToKeysym to obtain the KeySym defined for that string.
	Verify that XStringToKeysym did not return NoSymbol.
	Verify that the returned string is correct.
>>ASSERTION A XStringToKeysym-3
When the string argument is the name of a KeySym in the
table with the prefix XK_ removed, then a call to
XStringToKeysym returns that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym name in table with code 3:
	Call XStringToKeysym to obtain the KeySym defined for that string.
	Verify that XStringToKeysym did not return NoSymbol.
	Verify that the returned string is correct.
>>ASSERTION A XStringToKeysym-4
When the string argument is the name of a KeySym in the
table with the prefix XK_ removed, then a call to
XStringToKeysym returns that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym name in table with code 4:
	Call XStringToKeysym to obtain the KeySym defined for that string.
	Verify that XStringToKeysym did not return NoSymbol.
	Verify that the returned string is correct.
>>ASSERTION A XStringToKeysym-5
When the string argument is the name of a KeySym in the
table with the prefix XK_ removed, then a call to
XStringToKeysym returns that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym name in table with code A:
	Call XStringToKeysym to obtain the KeySym defined for that string.
	Verify that XStringToKeysym did not return NoSymbol.
	Verify that the returned string is correct.
>>ASSERTION A XStringToKeysym-6
When the string argument is the name of a KeySym in the
table with the prefix XK_ removed, then a call to
XStringToKeysym returns that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym name in table with code C:
	Call XStringToKeysym to obtain the KeySym defined for that string.
	Verify that XStringToKeysym did not return NoSymbol.
	Verify that the returned string is correct.
>>ASSERTION A XStringToKeysym-7
When the string argument is the name of a KeySym in the
table with the prefix XK_ removed, then a call to
XStringToKeysym returns that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym name in table with code G:
	Call XStringToKeysym to obtain the KeySym defined for that string.
	Verify that XStringToKeysym did not return NoSymbol.
	Verify that the returned string is correct.
>>ASSERTION A XStringToKeysym-8
When the string argument is the name of a KeySym in the
table with the prefix XK_ removed, then a call to
XStringToKeysym returns that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym name in table with code H:
	Call XStringToKeysym to obtain the KeySym defined for that string.
	Verify that XStringToKeysym did not return NoSymbol.
	Verify that the returned string is correct.
>>ASSERTION A XStringToKeysym-9
When the string argument is the name of a KeySym in the
table with the prefix XK_ removed, then a call to
XStringToKeysym returns that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym name in table with code K:
	Call XStringToKeysym to obtain the KeySym defined for that string.
	Verify that XStringToKeysym did not return NoSymbol.
	Verify that the returned string is correct.
>>ASSERTION A XStringToKeysym-10
When the string argument is the name of a KeySym in the
table with the prefix XK_ removed, then a call to
XStringToKeysym returns that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym name in table with code L:

	Call XStringToKeysym to obtain the KeySym defined for that string.
	Verify that XStringToKeysym did not return NoSymbol.
	Verify that the returned string is correct.
>>ASSERTION A XStringToKeysym-12
When the string argument is the name of a KeySym in the
table with the prefix XK_ removed, then a call to
XStringToKeysym returns that KeySym.

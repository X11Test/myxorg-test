>>TITLE XLookupColor Xopen
>>ASSERTION A XLookupColor-1
When a colour name in the table is recognised on a call to
XLookupColor, then all other colour names on the same line
of the table are also recognised on another call to
XLookupColor using the same display and colormap, and the
same values are returned by each call to XLookupColor in the
red, green and blue components of the XColor structures
named by the exact_def_return argument and screen_def_return
arguments.
>>STRATEGY
For each supported visual type:
  Create a colourmap of that type using XCreateColormap.
  For each equivalent colour name:
    Obtain the rgb values for the colour.
    Verify that the exact rgb values are identical.
    Verify that the supported rbg values are identical.
>>ASSERTION A XLookupColor-2
When a colour name in the table is recognised on a call to
XLookupColor, and a colour name on a different line of the
table is also recognised on another call to XLookupColor
using the same display and colormap, then distinct values
are returned by each call to XLookupColor in the red, green
and blue components of the XColor structures named by the
exact_def_return argument and screen_def_return arguments.
>>STRATEGY
For each supported visual:
  Create a colourmap of that type using XCreateColormap.
  For each pair of colour names in the table:
    Obtain the rgb values corresponding to the name using XLookupColor.
    Verify that the rgb triples are different.
>>ASSERTION A XLookupColor-3
When a colour name in the table is recognised on a call to
XLookupColor, then the colour name with the first letter of
each word in upper-case and with no spaces between words is
also recognised on another call to XLookupColor using the
same display and colormap, and the same values are returned
by each call to XLookupColor in the red, green and blue
components of the XColor structures named by the
exact_def_return argument and screen_def_return arguments.
>>STRATEGY
For each supported visual type:
  Create a colourmap of that type using XCreateColormap.
  For each equivalent colour name:
    Obtain the rgb values for the colour.
    Verify that the exact rgb values are identical.
    Verify that the supported rbg values are identical.
>>ASSERTION A XLookupColor-4
All colour names in the table which are in set A are
recognised on a call to XLookupColor.
>>STRATEGY
For each supported visual type:
  Create a colourmap of that type using XCreateColormap.
  For the colournames in the table:
    Obtain the rgb values for the colour using XLookupColor.
    Verify that the call did not return 0.
>>ASSERTION C XLookupColor-5
If any of the visual classes GrayScale or StaticGray
support colourmaps with at least four colour cells: When the
visual type of the colormap argument is GrayScale or
StaticGray, and colormap has at least four colour cells,
then all colour names in the table which are in set M are
recognised on a call to XLookupColor.
>>STRATEGY
If the server supports GrayScale or StaticGray with colourmap size greater than 4:
  For those supported visuals:
    Create a colourmap using XCreateColormap.
    For each colour name in the table:
      Obtain the rgb values for the for the colour using XLookupColor.
      Verify that the call did not return 0.
>>ASSERTION C XLookupColor-6
If any of the visual classes PseudoColor, StaticColor,
TrueColor, or DirectColor are supported: When the visual
type of the colormap argument is PseudoColor, StaticColor,
TrueColor, or DirectColor, then all colour names in the
table which are in set C are recognised on a call to
XLookupColor.
>>STRATEGY
For each supported visual type from PseudoColor, StaticColor, TrueColor and DirectColor:
  Create a colourmap of that type using XCreateColormap.
  For the colournames in the table:
    Obtain the rgb values for the colour using XLookupColor.
    Verify that the call did not return 0.
>>ASSERTION A XLookupColor-7
When a colour name in the table which is in set M, V or X
is recognised on a call to XLookupColor, then all other
colour names in the table which are in set C, M, or V are
also recognised on another call to XLookupColor.
>>STRATEGY
If a colourname in sets M, V or X causes XLookupColor to return non-zero:
  For each supported visual:
    Verify that all the colour names in C, M and V also cause XLookupColor to return non-zero:

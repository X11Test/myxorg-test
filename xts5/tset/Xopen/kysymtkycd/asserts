>>ASSERTION A XKeysymToKeycode-1
When the keysym argument is a KeySym in the table which is
defined and has code 1, then a call to XKeysymToKeycode
returns the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym in table with code 1:
	Call XKeysymToKeycode to obtain the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
	Call XKeycodeToKeysym to obtain each KeySym for that KeyCode.
	Verify that one of the KeySyms returned is the original KeySym.
>>ASSERTION A XKeysymToKeycode-2
When the keysym argument is a KeySym in the table which is
defined and has code 2, then a call to XKeysymToKeycode
returns the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym in table with code 2:
	Call XKeysymToKeycode to obtain the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
	Call XKeycodeToKeysym to obtain each KeySym for that KeyCode.
	Verify that one of the KeySyms returned is the original KeySym.
>>ASSERTION A XKeysymToKeycode-3
When the keysym argument is a KeySym in the table which is
defined and has code 3, then a call to XKeysymToKeycode
returns the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym in table with code 3:
	Call XKeysymToKeycode to obtain the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
	Call XKeycodeToKeysym to obtain each KeySym for that KeyCode.
	Verify that one of the KeySyms returned is the original KeySym.
>>ASSERTION A XKeysymToKeycode-4
When the keysym argument is a KeySym in the table which is
defined and has code 4, then a call to XKeysymToKeycode
returns the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym in table with code 4:
	Call XKeysymToKeycode to obtain the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
	Call XKeycodeToKeysym to obtain each KeySym for that KeyCode.
	Verify that one of the KeySyms returned is the original KeySym.
>>ASSERTION A XKeysymToKeycode-5
When the keysym argument is a KeySym in the table which is
defined and has code A, then a call to XKeysymToKeycode
returns the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym in table with code A:
	Call XKeysymToKeycode to obtain the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
	Call XKeycodeToKeysym to obtain each KeySym for that KeyCode.
	Verify that one of the KeySyms returned is the original KeySym.
>>ASSERTION A XKeysymToKeycode-6
When the keysym argument is a KeySym in the table which is
defined and has code C, then a call to XKeysymToKeycode
returns the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym in table with code C:
	Call XKeysymToKeycode to obtain the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
	Call XKeycodeToKeysym to obtain each KeySym for that KeyCode.
	Verify that one of the KeySyms returned is the original KeySym.
>>ASSERTION A XKeysymToKeycode-7
When the keysym argument is a KeySym in the table which is
defined and has code G, then a call to XKeysymToKeycode
returns the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym in table with code G:
	Call XKeysymToKeycode to obtain the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
	Call XKeycodeToKeysym to obtain each KeySym for that KeyCode.
	Verify that one of the KeySyms returned is the original KeySym.
>>ASSERTION A XKeysymToKeycode-8
When the keysym argument is a KeySym in the table which is
defined and has code H, then a call to XKeysymToKeycode
returns the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym in table with code H:
	Call XKeysymToKeycode to obtain the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
	Call XKeycodeToKeysym to obtain each KeySym for that KeyCode.
	Verify that one of the KeySyms returned is the original KeySym.
>>ASSERTION A XKeysymToKeycode-9
When the keysym argument is a KeySym in the table which is
defined and has code K, then a call to XKeysymToKeycode
returns the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym in table with code K:
	Call XKeysymToKeycode to obtain the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
	Call XKeycodeToKeysym to obtain each KeySym for that KeyCode.
	Verify that one of the KeySyms returned is the original KeySym.
>>ASSERTION A XKeysymToKeycode-10
When the keysym argument is a KeySym in the table which is
defined and has code L, then a call to XKeysymToKeycode
returns the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym in table with code L:
	Call XKeysymToKeycode to obtain the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
	Call XKeycodeToKeysym to obtain each KeySym for that KeyCode.
	Verify that one of the KeySyms returned is the original KeySym.
>>ASSERTION A XKeysymToKeycode-11
When the keysym argument is a KeySym in the table which is
defined and has code M, then a call to XKeysymToKeycode
returns the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym in table with code M:
	Call XKeysymToKeycode to obtain the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
	Call XKeycodeToKeysym to obtain each KeySym for that KeyCode.
	Verify that one of the KeySyms returned is the original KeySym.
>>ASSERTION A XKeysymToKeycode-12
When the keysym argument is a KeySym in the table which is
defined and has code P, then a call to XKeysymToKeycode
returns the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
>>STRATEGY
For each KeySym in table with code P:
	Call XKeysymToKeycode to obtain the KeyCode defined for that KeySym.
	Call XKeycodeToKeysym to obtain each KeySym for that KeyCode.

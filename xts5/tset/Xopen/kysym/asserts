>>ASSERTION A keysym-1
When the header file <X11/keysym.h> is included, then the
symbols in the table which have code 1 are defined to have
the hexadecimal values given in the table.
>>STRATEGY
Include header file <X11/keysym.h>
For each KeySym in table with code 1:
	Verify that the symbol is defined using #ifdef.
	Verify that the symbol has the expected value using #if.
>>ASSERTION A keysym-2
When the header file <X11/keysym.h> is included, then the
symbols in the table which have code 2 are defined to have
the hexadecimal values given in the table.
>>STRATEGY
Include header file <X11/keysym.h>
For each KeySym in table with code 2:
	Verify that the symbol is defined using #ifdef.
	Verify that the symbol has the expected value using #if.
>>ASSERTION A keysym-3
When the header file <X11/keysym.h> is included, then the
symbols in the table which have code 3 are defined to have
the hexadecimal values given in the table.
>>STRATEGY
Include header file <X11/keysym.h>
For each KeySym in table with code 3:
	Verify that the symbol is defined using #ifdef.
	Verify that the symbol has the expected value using #if.
>>ASSERTION A keysym-4
When the header file <X11/keysym.h> is included, then the
symbols in the table which have code 4 are defined to have
the hexadecimal values given in the table.
>>STRATEGY
Include header file <X11/keysym.h>
For each KeySym in table with code 4:
	Verify that the symbol is defined using #ifdef.
	Verify that the symbol has the expected value using #if.
>>ASSERTION A keysym-5
When the header file <X11/keysym.h> is included, then the
symbols in the table which have code G are defined to have
the hexadecimal values given in the table.
>>STRATEGY
Include header file <X11/keysym.h>
For each KeySym in table with code G:
	Verify that the symbol is defined using #ifdef.
	Verify that the symbol has the expected value using #if.
>>ASSERTION A keysym-6
When the header file <X11/keysym.h> is included, then the
symbols in the table which have code M are defined to have
the hexadecimal values given in the table.
>>STRATEGY
Include header file <X11/keysym.h>
For each KeySym in table with code M:
	Verify that the symbol is defined using #ifdef.
	Verify that the symbol has the expected value using #if.
>>ASSERTION A keysym-7
When the header file <X11/keysym.h> is included, then the
symbols in the table are defined to have the hexadecimal
values given in the table.
>>STRATEGY
Include header file <X11/keysym.h>
For each KeySym in table:
	Verify that the symbol is defined using #ifdef.
	Verify that the symbol has the expected value using #if.

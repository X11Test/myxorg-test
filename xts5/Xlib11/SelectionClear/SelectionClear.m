>>TITLE SelectionClear Xlib11
>>ASSERTION Good A
There are no assertions in sections 8.1-8.4 for xname events.
Assertions will be submitted from section 4 which will cover

Put out a message explaining that there are no specific assertions for
xname events in sections 8.1-8.4, and that delivery of xname events will
be covered in section 4.

	report("There are no specific assertions for %s events in sections 8.1-8.4.", TestName);
